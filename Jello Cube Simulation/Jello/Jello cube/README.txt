================

<Description of what you have accomplished>
<Also, explain any extra credit that you have implemented.>

->Created three types of springs: structural, shear, and bend
->Used Hooke's Law for spring forces: F = -k(|L| - R) * (L/|L|)
->Implemented damping forces: F = -d((v_A - v_B) Â· L/|L|) * (L/|L|)
->Computed structural forces for direct neighbors
->Implemented shear forces for face and space diagonals
->Calculated bend forces for every second neighbor
->Applied half damping for shear and bend springs
->Implemented bounding box collisions using penalty method

Extra Credit:

->Created inclined plane collision detection and response
->Used collision springs with adjustable stiffness and damping
->Change Light colours giving different colours to jello cube
